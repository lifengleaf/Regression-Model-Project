# Explore the Relationship Between MPG and Transmission Type
This is the course project for Regression Models on Coursera.   
In this project we analyze `mtcars`, which is a data set containing fuel consumption (mpg) 
and 10 aspects of automobile design and
performance for 32 automobiles extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend Magazine.  
We’ll explore the relationship between mpg and other variables, with focus on two questions:  
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for mpg?  
2. What’s the mpg difference between automatic and manual transmissions?  
You can find the final report [here](http://rpubs.com/lifeng/148163).
